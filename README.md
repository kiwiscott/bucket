## Bucket

> This project serves two purposes. The first is to server as a bucket  for some of our projects to store documents in cassandra. The second is a learning project with different python technologies.


## architecture

Code design wide this project implements full end to end coverage:
# written as test first
# an architecture build on inward facing dependencies only. This is an interesting view on how to develop software and very much aligned to my own. Everything is testable from the start and technology decision are deffered. v1 of the application is the entities, use case code only.
